      Miking (Meta vIKING) is a meta language system for creating
      embedded domain-specific and general-purpose languages.  The
      system features a polymorphic core calculus and a DSL definition
      language where languages can be extended and composed from
      smaller fragments.

      Note: Depending on the target runtime, miking requires the presence of
      additional packages within an environment, such as dune, ocaml, findlib
      and a C compiler for native builds, node for javascript, and a suitable JDK
      when targeting the JVM.
